Model 1: The differences are minor grammatical adjustments and the addition of a more specific locality (Çağırkan) within the already stated Kaman District, which provides deeper detail but does not alter the fundamental understanding of the museum's location. Model 2: The new revision provides a more precise location for the museum by adding "Çağırkan," which enhances the factual accuracy and completeness of the article. Human: The addition of a city name adds detail but doesn’t change the main content. Noteworthy: False.
Model 1: The differences are not noteworthy because the change only involves the removal of a single word ("lucky"), which is a minor word choice correction and does not alter the facts, people, places, dates, or analysis of the event. Model 2: The new revision removes the inappropriate word "lucky" when referring to the people killed, correcting the tone and factual accuracy of the sentence, which is a noteworthy change. Human: The word “lucky” is vandalism that radically alters the tone and destroys the neutrality of the article. Noteworthy: True.
Model 1: The new revision adds "juvenile detention" and changes "sexual affairs" to "sexual awakening" as key life events for the protagonist István, which constitutes a change to major events in his life story. Model 2: The new revision adds minor details about the protagonist's journey and makes a few stylistic changes, but these do not substantially alter the overall summary or critical reception of the novel. Human: The change from “sexual affairs” to “sexual awakening” is a nuance in interpretation that doesn’t warrant a noteworthy label. Noteworthy: False.
Model 1: The differences are not noteworthy as they only involve an update to the population data with a more recent projection, which constitutes a deeper analysis of a topic without changing the overall conclusion or major facts about the department. Model 2: The new revision updates the population data for Cundinamarca by adding 2023 projections, which is a significant improvement in accuracy and currency for an informational article. Human: The population projections for 2023 make the article five years more up-to-date, which is a significant change. Noteworthy: True.
Model 1: The differences are not noteworthy because they primarily consist of deeper analysis and minor clarifications, such as adding pronunciation, specifying the French origin, and detailing seating configurations, rather than changing the fundamental definition or conclusion about what a coupe is. Model 2: The new revision significantly expands the definition of a 'coupe' by adding pronunciation, clarifying the typical door count, detailing seating configurations, and distinguishing it from a 'sports coupe', which provides a more comprehensive understanding of the term. Human: The changes are noteworthy for extending the definition of a coupe to include four seats and addition of different pronunciations in the US and elsewhere.   Noteworthy: True.
Model 1: The differences are not noteworthy as they involve minor rephrasing, a slight broadening of scope for roof variations, and the removal of "cargo space" as a listed drawback, none of which substantially alters the overall conclusion or understanding of convertibles. Model 2: The new revision removes "cargo space" as a stated potential drawback of convertibles and rephrases the description of reduced structural rigidity, altering the completeness of the information regarding convertible disadvantages. Human: There are small changes like “models” vs “eras and manufacturers” and not mentioning cargo space in the new revision, but these don’t alter crucial information. Noteworthy: False.
Model 1: The differences are noteworthy because they include changes to biographical details such as the addition of a middle name, the removal of a birthplace, and a change in nationality from English to British. Model 2: The new revision makes minor changes to the subject's full name, nationality, and birth details, which do not substantially affect the biographical overview. Human: The change from the birth city (Sheffield, South Yorkshire) to “British” is a matter of reporting depth rather than an actual change to the facts and therefore is not notable for most readers.

Model 1: The differences between the revisions are not noteworthy as they primarily consist of minor grammatical and wording changes, the removal of a specific historical detail about aluminium's use in the World Wars, and the addition of a sentence providing deeper analysis about its density, none of which alter the main conclusions or understanding of the topic. Model 2: The new revision is noteworthy because it adds a scientific detail explaining that aluminium's low standard atomic weight contributes to its low density, which is responsible for many of its uses, thus enhancing the reader's understanding of its properties and applications. Human: The new revision adds that “aluminium” is the preferred IUPAC name and also gives a reason for the relatively low density compared to other metals, both of which contribute to a more complete overview. Noteworthy: True.
Model 1: The differences between the revisions are not noteworthy as they primarily involve minor rephrasing, changes in structure, and deeper analysis of the engine assembly process (such as the  Model 2: The new revision provides more specific and detailed information regarding the assembly process of the different engine variants, clarifying the 'one man, one engine' principle for AMG engines versus machine assembly for mainstream Mercedes-Benz models. Human: The new revision omits the detail about two blocks sharing a single crankshaft, but this is implied by the M133 ancestry, and also has less detail about where specific variants are manufactured, none of which are highly notable changes. Noteworthy: False.
Model 1: The differences are noteworthy because the new revision adds Bayden Barber's birth year, which is a change to a date/personal detail. Model 2: The new revision adds a birth year and corrects a spelling of a Māori term, which are minor factual updates that do not substantially change the biographical overview. Human: Birth year is important information for a biographical entry. Noteworthy: True.
Model 1: The differences are not noteworthy as they primarily consist of minor word choice changes, rephrasing, removal of descriptive details, and a clarification regarding Yorkshire's current administrative status and the specific dynasty of the House of York, none of which alter the overall meaning or conclusion about Yorkshire's history and identity. Model 2: The new revision clarifies that Yorkshire is no longer used for administration, adds important historical context about the "Plantagenet" royal House of York, and refines some geographical descriptions, leading to a more precise and updated overview of the region. Human: The mention of “no longer being used for administration” is a notable change in the new revision; text clean-up (less repetition of compass directions), and a name in the emblem’s origin (Plantagenet) are changes that would not be counted as noteworthy. Noteworthy: True.
Model 1: The differences are not noteworthy because they consist of minor statistical updates (death toll), small factual additions (Lincoln as Republican, Lincoln giving Grant command), and a more explicit but not substantially different analysis of the Confederacy's motivation for secession related to slavery, which does not change the overall conclusion that slavery was the central cause of the war. Model 2: The new revision explicitly states that the Confederacy was formed to preserve African American slavery and clarifies that Lincoln gave Grant command of Union armies, providing a more precise and complete account of the war's origins and leadership. Human: These revisions introduce the article with quite different settings of the conflict (“expand in the western territories” vs “the election of Abraham Lincoln and the abolitionist movement in the North”), resulting in a noteworthy difference in historical outlook. Noteworthy: True.
Model 1: The new revision adds a specific, technical detail about the duration of 1908, which provides a deeper analysis of the topic without changing the overall conclusion or introducing new people, places, dates, or major events. Model 2: The new revision adds a significant factual detail, stating that 1908 was the longest year in either the Julian or Gregorian calendars, measured in Terrestrial Time. Human: The fact that 1908 was the longest year in either calendar would be a piece of trivia in other contexts, but on the Wikipedia page for the year itself is a notable mention of a record-breaking characteristic. Noteworthy: True.
Model 1: The new revision only adds "mass population displacement" as an additional contributing factor to the population decline, which is a minor detail that does not alter the overall analysis or conclusion of the article. Model 2: The new revision adds "mass population displacement" as a contributing factor to the sharp decline in the Congolese population, which provides a more complete understanding of the atrocities' impact. Human: The addition of mass population displacement as a cause of population decline is a noteworthy change in the new revision. Noteworthy: True.
Model 1: The differences are not noteworthy as they consist of minor word choice changes like "locals" to "Indigenous people," grammatical adjustments, and the addition of the French name for the state, none of which alter the core facts, analysis, or conclusion of the article. Model 2: The new revision improves factual accuracy by adding the French name of the state and uses more precise and respectful terminology by changing "locals" to "Indigenous people" when referring to the inhabitants. Human: There are minor changes in wording (e.g. “went there” vs “visited it” and “local” vs “Indigenous”) that do not substantially alter the information presented.  Noteworthy: False.
Model 1: The new revision adds 'and photographer' to the description of Howard H. Baker Jr.'s professions, which is a factual detail that offers a slightly deeper understanding of his overall life but does not change the main narrative or conclusions about his political and diplomatic career. Model 2: The new revision adds "and photographer" to Howard Henry Baker Jr.'s listed professions, which is a noteworthy addition to his biographical overview.

Model 1: The differences are not noteworthy as they involve minor word choice changes, the addition of a colloquial nickname for the city ("La Nevera"), and the removal of a general descriptive phrase ("one of the largest cities in the world"), none of which substantially alter the main facts, analysis, or conclusion about Bogotá. Model 2: The new revision removes the claim that Bogotá is "one of the largest cities in the world" and adds a new nickname, which significantly alters the description of the city's global standing and cultural information. Human: The new revision adds a nickname ("La Nevera" (The Fridge")) that makes the changes noteworthy; the ommision of minor trivia (“one of the largest cities in the world”) is not a notable change. Noteworthy: True.
